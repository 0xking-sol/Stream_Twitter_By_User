# Stream_Twitter_By_User
Code that lets you stream twitter according to a given user or set of users

This is my first open source project because it is the first one that I have worked on that doesn't operate in a terms and conditions grey area.

The code will print out any tweets from a given user to your terminal. The example is set to Elon Musk but you should be able to add additional users. For some reason I struggled to find this clearly explained online.

If you run into issues, try using stream.delete_rules(), and make sure that you delete all of them. Then you can start again and this should fix it.
